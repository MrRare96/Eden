If you have any questions or some kind of feedback, please post it there. 

If you are not a coder and just want the program download links are also there, you can download the .zip archive here if you want to 
download from here. 

I DO NOT OWN HydraIRC or MPC-HC, IF THEIR RIGHTFULL OWNER WANTS THEM TO BE REMOVED, CONTACT ME @:
rareamvproductions@gmail.com

If a coder wants to import this program, make sure you that you put the folders in the archive in bin/debug!
I am sorry for the messy code, I am new to oop and new to gui's, so I just did things till they worked XD
